# Transformer Fine-Tuning for Custom Dataset

For this exercise, I fine-tuned the pre-trained GPT-2 model on a custom dataset. The dataset comprised a collection of scientific articles related to climate change and renewable energy. The goal of fine-tuning was to enhance the model's ability to generate coherent and relevant text on topics related to environmental sustainability.

## Steps Taken:

1. **Data Preparation:** I preprocessed the dataset by tokenizing the text and formatting it in a way suitable for input to the GPT-2 model. This involved converting the text into tokens and adding special tokens like `[CLS]` for classification and `[SEP]` for separating segments of text.

2. **Model Training:** Using the `pytorch-transformers` library, I loaded the pre-trained GPT-2 model and added a classification head for fine-tuning. I then trained the model on the custom dataset, adjusting hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of training epochs to optimize performance.

3. **Evaluation:** After training, I evaluated the fine-tuned model using metrics such as perplexity and accuracy on a validation dataset. This step helped ensure that the model was learning effectively and producing high-quality outputs.

4. **Text Generation:** Finally, I used the fine-tuned model to generate a new paragraph based on a given sentence. The model's enhanced understanding of environmental topics allowed it to produce coherent and insightful text relevant to the subject matter.

In conclusion, fine-tuning the pre-trained GPT-2 model on a custom dataset can significantly improve its performance and make it more adept at generating relevant and contextually appropriate text for specific domains or topics.
